                Libraries have always been central to education and community development. 
                They provide access to knowledge, literature, and technology to people of all ages and backgrounds.
            </p>
            <p class="history">
                Our library was established in 1998 with the goal of serving the local community
                by providing free access to books, knowledge, and learning resources.
                What started with just a few shelves of donated books has now grown into a full community center, 
                offering thousands of titles across all genres, as well as educational programs and digital resources.
                Over the years, we’ve adapted to new technologies and added computers, e-books, and an online catalog—ensuring that knowledge
                remains accessible to everyone
